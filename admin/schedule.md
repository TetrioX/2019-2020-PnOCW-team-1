# Week 3

- Dennis, Maxel and Simon C fix the basic application framework.
- Geert, Simon T and Xander begin think of an algorithm we can use for screen detection.

# Week 4

- Geert, Simon T and Xander finish the basic screen detection. The others catch up with them.

# Week 5

- Geert, Simon C and Simon T work further on advanced screen detection. Xander works on orientation and perspective.
- Dennis and Maxel start with Delaunay triangulation.

# Week 6

- Geert and Xander implement the screen detection algorithm and integrate their different pieces of code.
- Simon T works on countdown, Simon C on image show off.
- Dennis and Maxel finish Delaunay triangulation.

# Week 7

- We try to integrate the different parts of our project.
- Get everything working for the demo day.

# Week 8

 ###### (still to decide)
- ... improve screen detection
- ... fix bugs
- ... make animation 
- ... implement test cases
